# ⚡ VOLT  
### *Decentralized Build System in Web3*

---

## 💡 THE PROBLEM

Every time a developer ships code, they pass through a fragile, centralized build chain:

- CI servers like Jenkins or GitHub Actions  
- Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Vercel  
- Opaque build tools and deployment scripts  
- Invisible artifact storage  

This process is fine for Web2.  
But in Web3 — where code is public, immutable, and trustless — it's a problem.

**If you can't prove how software was built, you can't trust what it does.**

---

## 🔓 THE TRUTH

The current software supply chain is a black box.

- You can't trace how smart contracts were compiled.  
- You can't verify who ran the tests.  
- You can't reproduce a build once the CI job disappears.  
- You trust GitHub to be online. You trust Jenkins to be honest.  

This is **not acceptable** in an ecosystem built on verifiability.

## 🚀 THE PRINCIPLE

**Build processes should be decentralized, deterministic, and verifiable.**

- Pipelines should be **defined on-chain**  
- Build jobs should be **triggered by events**  
- Artifacts should be **hash-verified and pinned**  
- Runners should be **permissionless and incentivized**  
- All steps — test, compile, audit, deploy — should be **transparent and reproducible**

---

## ⚙️ THE VISION

Volt transforms the blockchain into a programmable CI/CD system:

- **Push code** → emit a chain event  
- **Builders** pick up the job and produce verifiable outputs  
- **Auditors** review and approve  
- **Deployers** finalize with full traceability  
- **Artifacts** are stored on IPFS/Arweave  
- **Logs** are events on-chain  

No more opaque pipelines.  
No more “just trust us.”  
Everything is **provable**.

## 🧩 USE CASES

- Trustless smart contract pipelines  
- DAO-governed deployment approvals  
- zk rollup verifier builds  
- On-chain game update workflows  
- Git push → verify → deploy → prove  
- Infrastructure as code for L2s, DAOs, and dApps

---

## 🛡️ THE BENEFITS

- ✅ Transparent, inspectable build history  
- ⛓️ No reliance on centralized CI/CD platforms  
- 🔁 Fully reproducible pipelines  
- 💰 Incentivized, decentralized job execution  
- 🌍 Language/toolchain agnostic  
- 🧠 Native support for Web3 workflows

---

## 📣 CALL TO BUILDERS

If you believe:

- Software infrastructure should be **public, not private**  
- CI/CD should be **provable, not opaque**  
- Pipelines should be **composable and decentralized**
- Teams should be able to build publicly **without compromising security or exposing IP rights**
  

Then you already believe in **Volt**.

We’re building a world where:

> The cloud is not your pipeline.  
> The chain is.
